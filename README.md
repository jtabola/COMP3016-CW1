## **Dependencies & Resources**
This project was developed using the following tools and libraries:

- **Coding Environment**: Visual Studio 2022
- **C++ Standard Libraries**:
  - `#include <iostream>`: For input and output stream operations.
  - `#include <fstream>`: For file handling.
  - `#include <string>`: For using string data type.
  - `#include <vector>`: For using dynamic arrays.
  - `#include <conio.h>`: For console input/output functions (like `getch()`).
  - `#include <cstdlib>`: For general purpose functions (e.g., memory allocation, random number generation).
  - `#include <ctime>`: For working with date and time functions.

- **Map Files**:
  - `map.txt`: First level of the game.
  - `map2.txt`: Second level of the game.
  - `map3.txt`: Third level of the game.
  - `map4.txt`: Fourth level of the game that the player can access after completing all the previous levels and buying it from the shop.
  - `player_data.txt`: Player's information that should be automatically generated with default values at game start.

Make sure you have the necessary environment, libraries, and resources set up before running the project.
